								<h1>Hi. I'm <strong>Ziggy Ghassemi</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
							<p>And this is <strong>My UCLA Graduate Portfolio</strong>, this portfolio is a compilation of my academic work during my enrollment at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). This portfolio’s purpose is to exhibit my progression -- both as a student of archival studies and information professional throughout my two years at UCLA (between 2021 and 2023) and in the Digital Humanities Graduate Certificate. </p>

						<h2>Accessiblity Statement.</h2>
						<p>
Accessibility is a critical aspect that every informational professional should strive for, whether it is making archival material discoverable through metadata or designing websites. As an informational professional, I am committed to ensuring that my website is accessible to everyone, including differently-abled people and those who may not have access to sufficient tools to view my portfolio. To achieve this, I adhere to the globally recognized Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, which provide a comprehensive set of standards for digital accessibility.

To ensure accessibility, I have designed my website with the following features:

<br><p><strong> Arrangement</strong>: I have made sure that my website is easily navigable by using a hierarchical heading structure. This makes it easy for users to understand the content and find what they are looking for.
</br></p>

<br><p><strong>Essays</strong>: For each section with an essay project, I have made downloadable PDFs of the paper available to ensure access to a wide-ranging audience. Instead of text walls, users will find a project description and the paper's abstract, which I believe improves the user experience.</br></p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: To ensure readability, I have opted for a plain black text on white background site instead of using color, which can detract from text visibility.</br></p>

<br><p><strong>Downloads</strong>: All written work on my website is available in PDF format to ensure that users can view it easily on any device without the need for additional software.</p>

While I have taken significant measures to ensure accessibility, I also recognize that I have limitations in website design. Therefore, I welcome and appreciate feedback from users. If you have any suggestions or encounter any accessibility issues while using my website, please feel free to contact me by clicking here or navigating to the “Contact” tab in the site's menu.
